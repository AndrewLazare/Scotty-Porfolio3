    // The result is  equal to 5  result = result * (n - 1)  
    // n = n - 1; is saying take the result  minus one then multiply it by the original result ...this happens all the way down to n - 1
    //Is 1 > 1 no...so it comes out of the while loop so and returns that value and writes it to the document object
